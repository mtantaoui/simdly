**Overall Summary:**

`simdly` demonstrates significant performance advantages, particularly for:

1.  **Computationally intensive operations** (Cosine, ArcSine, ArcCosine) across all data sizes, where its non-parallel SIMD implementation consistently outperforms scalar and `ndarray` by a large margin.
2.  **Large datasets** (especially 4M elements and above) when using its `parallel simd` variants, which effectively utilize multiple cores to overcome memory bandwidth limitations and scale well.

For **memory-bandwidth-bound operations** (like Addition, Absolute Value) on **smaller datasets**, the overhead of `simdly`'s non-parallel SIMD can sometimes make it slightly slower than highly optimized scalar code or `ndarray` (which itself might be using auto-vectorization or simple SIMD for basic operations). However, as dataset sizes increase, this difference diminishes, and all non-parallel methods tend to converge, bottlenecked by memory speed. This is where `parallel simd (simdly)` then provides a clear advantage.

**Detailed Analysis by Operation:**

**1. Addition:**

- **Small to Medium Data (1024 to 262144 elements):**
  - `scalar` and `ndarray` are consistently the fastest, and very close to each other.
  - `simd (simdly)` is noticeably slower (e.g., at 1024 elements, ~125 ns vs ~82 ns for scalar/ndarray). This suggests that for simple, memory-bound operations on small data, the overhead of explicit SIMD dispatch in `simdly` outweighs the benefits, or the compiler is already doing a good job auto-vectorizing the scalar/`ndarray` loops.
- **Large Data (4194304 elements and above):**
  - `scalar`, `simd (simdly)`, and `ndarray` performance becomes very similar (e.g., around 640 µs / 24 GiB/s for 4M elements). This indicates the operation is primarily memory-bandwidth limited.
  - `parallel simd (simdly)` shows a strong advantage here, significantly boosting throughput by utilizing multiple cores.
    - At 4M elements: ~443 µs (35.2 GiB/s) vs ~640 µs (24.4 GiB/s) – roughly a **1.44x speedup** over non-parallel.
    - At 16M elements: ~3.59 ms (17.4 GiB/s) vs ~7.4-7.6 ms (8.2-8.3 GiB/s) – roughly a **2.1x speedup**.
    - At 32M elements: ~6.78 ms (18.4 GiB/s) vs ~14.2-15.0 ms (8.3-8.7 GiB/s) – roughly a **2.1-2.2x speedup**.

**Key Takeaway for Addition:**
`simdly` (non-parallel) isn't advantageous for small-to-medium additions. For large additions, `parallel simd (simdly)` is the clear winner.

**2. Cosine:**

This is where `simdly` truly shines due to the higher computational cost per element.

- **All Data Sizes (1024 to 33554432 elements):**
  - `simd (simdly)` is dramatically faster than `scalar`, `ndarray`, and `ndarray-stats`.
    - 1024 elements: `simdly` ~474 ns (8.0 GiB/s) vs scalar/ndarray ~2.1 µs (1.8 GiB/s) – **~4.4x speedup**.
    - 16384 elements: `simdly` ~7.3 µs (8.3 GiB/s) vs scalar/ndarray ~52 µs (1.17 GiB/s) – **~7.1x speedup**.
    - 262144 elements: `simdly` ~115 µs (8.4 GiB/s) vs scalar/ndarray ~925 µs (1.05 GiB/s) – **~8.0x speedup**.
  - `scalar`, `ndarray`, and `ndarray-stats` perform very similarly to each other.
- **Large Data (4194304 elements and above):**
  - `parallel simd (simdly)` provides another substantial leap in performance.
    - 4M elements: `parallel simdly` ~847 µs (18.4 GiB/s) vs non-parallel `simdly` ~2.53 ms (6.1 GiB/s) – **~3.0x speedup** over its already fast non-parallel version.
    - 16M elements: `parallel simdly` ~3.35 ms (18.6 GiB/s) vs non-parallel `simdly` ~10.8 ms (5.8 GiB/s) – **~3.2x speedup**.
    - 32M elements: `parallel simdly` ~6.68 ms (18.7 GiB/s) vs non-parallel `simdly` ~22.7 ms (5.4 GiB/s) – **~3.4x speedup**.

**Key Takeaway for Cosine:**
`simdly` (both non-parallel and parallel) is vastly superior for Cosine calculations. The benefits of SIMD are very pronounced for this computationally heavier function.

**3. Absolute Value:**

The pattern is similar to Addition, as `abs()` is a relatively lightweight operation.

- **Small to Medium Data (1024 to 262144 elements):**
  - `scalar` and `ndarray` are generally faster or competitive.
  - `simd (simdly)` is slower for 1024 elements (~115 ns vs ~70 ns) and 262144 elements (~24 µs vs ~16 µs). The 16384 size shows `simdly` closer but still slightly slower than scalar.
- **Large Data (4194304 elements and above):**
  - `scalar`, `simd (simdly)`, and `ndarray` performance converges, again indicating memory bandwidth limitations.
    - At 4M: All around ~1.4-1.5 ms (10-11 GiB/s)
  - `parallel simd (simdly)` provides a significant speedup.
    - At 4M elements: ~787 µs (19.8 GiB/s) vs ~1.4-1.5 ms – roughly a **1.8-1.9x speedup**.
    - At 16M elements: ~3.27 ms (19.1 GiB/s) vs ~6.6 ms – roughly a **2.0x speedup**.
    - At 32M elements: ~6.37 ms (19.6 GiB/s) vs ~13.0-13.5 ms – roughly a **2.0-2.1x speedup**.

**Key Takeaway for Absolute Value:**
Similar to Addition, non-parallel `simdly` struggles with overhead on smaller datasets. `parallel simd (simdly)` is highly effective for large datasets.

---

**4. ArcSine & 5. ArcCosine:**

These are computationally intensive, similar to Cosine. `ndarray` results are not available for direct comparison, so we compare `simdly` mainly against `scalar`.

- **All Data Sizes (1024 to 33554432 elements):**
  - `simd (simdly)` is significantly faster than `scalar`.
    - **ArcSine, 1024 elements:** `simdly` ~730 ns (5.2 GiB/s) vs scalar ~2.5 µs (1.5 GiB/s) – **~3.4x speedup**.
    - **ArcCosine, 1024 elements:** `simdly` ~780 ns (4.8 GiB/s) vs scalar ~2.5 µs (1.5 GiB/s) – **~3.2x speedup**.
    - This advantage holds and often grows for larger non-parallel datasets (e.g., ArcSine 262144: `simdly` ~178 µs vs scalar ~1.54 ms – **~8.6x speedup**).
- **Large Data (4194304 elements and above):**
  - `parallel simd (simdly)` again demonstrates excellent scaling.
    - **ArcSine, 4M elements:** `parallel simdly` ~1.13 ms (13.8 GiB/s) vs non-parallel `simdly` ~3.72 ms (4.2 GiB/s) – **~3.3x speedup**.
    - **ArcCosine, 4M elements:** `parallel simdly` ~1.15 ms (13.6 GiB/s) vs non-parallel `simdly` ~4.0 ms (3.9 GiB/s) – **~3.5x speedup**.
    - Speedups for 16M and 32M elements are similarly impressive (typically **~3.5x to ~4x** over non-parallel `simdly`).

**Key Takeaway for ArcSine/ArcCosine:**
`simdly` is the clear performance leader for these functions. The benefits of SIMD for complex math are substantial, and parallelism adds another layer of significant speedup for large data.

**General Trends & Discussion:**

1.  **SIMD Overhead vs. Computational Intensity:**

    - For lightweight, memory-bound operations (Addition, Abs), the overhead of `simdly`'s explicit SIMD invocation can be detrimental for smaller arrays where compiler auto-vectorization of simple scalar loops or `ndarray`'s internal handling is more efficient.
    - For computationally heavier operations (Cosine, ArcSine, ArcCosine), the per-element work done by SIMD instructions far outweighs the overhead, leading to substantial gains even on small arrays.

2.  **Memory Bandwidth Limitation:**

    - For large arrays and simple operations, the throughput of `scalar`, non-parallel `simd (simdly)`, and `ndarray` often converges (e.g., Addition at 4M elements all hover around 24 GiB/s). This is a classic sign of being memory-bandwidth limited. The CPU can process data faster than it can be fetched from RAM.

3.  **Effectiveness of Parallelism (`parallel simd (simdly)`):**

    - This is a standout feature. For large datasets, `parallel simd (simdly)` consistently delivers significant speedups (often 2x to 4x over the best non-parallel methods). This shows effective use of multiple CPU cores in conjunction with SIMD instructions on each core.
    - The speedup from parallelism is more pronounced when the non-parallel version is not already heavily memory-bandwidth saturated or when the operation is computationally intensive (allowing more work to be done per memory access).

4.  **`ndarray` Performance:**

    - `ndarray` is a highly optimized library. It performs very well for simple operations, likely benefiting from good loop structures that are amenable to compiler auto-vectorization or its own efficient iterators.
    - For more complex element-wise math functions (like Cosine), `ndarray` (without a specialized backend like MKL or OpenBLAS for these specific ufuncs) appears to fall back to scalar math or less optimized SIMD, where `simdly`'s dedicated SIMD routines excel.

5.  **Outliers:**
    - The presence of outliers is common in benchmarking due to OS jitter, cache effects, frequency scaling, etc. The reported median times are generally robust. The number of outliers here (often 10-15%) is a bit high in some cases but doesn't seem to invalidate the overall performance trends observed from the median values.

**Conclusion & Recommendations for `simdly`:**

- **Strengths:**

  - **Excellent for computationally intensive math:** `simdly` is the top performer for functions like Cosine, ArcSine, and ArcCosine, offering substantial speedups over scalar and `ndarray`'s default implementations.
  - **Superior scaling on large datasets with parallelism:** The `parallel simd` variants are highly effective, making `simdly` a great choice for processing large arrays where multi-core processing can be leveraged.

- **Areas for Consideration/Potential Improvement:**
  - **Small data performance for simple operations:** For operations like Addition and Abs on small arrays, `simdly` is currently slower. It might be worth investigating:
    - A "threshold" system: For array sizes below a certain N, `simdly` could internally fall back to a simple scalar loop to avoid SIMD overhead. This is a common strategy in high-performance libraries.
    - Further optimization of the SIMD setup/dispatch for these simple cases, though this can be challenging.
  - **Comparison with `ndarray` + BLAS/LAPACK features:** If `ndarray` were configured with a backend like `ndarray-linalg` using Intel MKL or OpenBLAS, its performance for some of these functions might improve. However, `simdly` offers a pure Rust, portable SIMD solution which is a valuable proposition.

**In summary, `simdly` is a powerful crate that clearly demonstrates the benefits of explicit SIMD and parallelization for numerical workloads in Rust. It excels where computational density is high or when large datasets can leverage parallelism. The performance on small, simple operations is a minor trade-off that could potentially be addressed with a hybrid approach.**

This data provides a strong case for using `simdly` in performance-critical applications involving f32 array computations, especially for trigonometric functions or when processing large volumes of data.
