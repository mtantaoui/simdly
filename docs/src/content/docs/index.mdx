## Why simdly?

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="SIMD Optimized" icon="rocket">
		Leverages AVX2 instructions for 256-bit vector operations, delivering exceptional performance for numerical computations.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Memory Efficient" icon="setting">
		Supports both aligned and unaligned memory access patterns with optimized data structures.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Safe Abstractions" icon="approve-check">
		Wraps unsafe SIMD operations in safe, ergonomic APIs that are easy to use and maintain.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Generic Traits" icon="puzzle">
		Provides consistent interfaces across different SIMD implementations for maximum flexibility.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Features

- **SIMD Optimized**: Leverages AVX2 instructions for 256-bit vector operations
- **Memory Efficient**: Supports both aligned and unaligned memory access patterns  
- **Generic Traits**: Provides consistent interfaces across different SIMD implementations
- **Safe Abstractions**: Wraps unsafe SIMD operations in safe, ergonomic APIs
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput numerical computations

## Architecture Support

Currently supports **x86/x86_64** with AVX2 (256-bit vectors).

Future support planned for SSE and ARM NEON architectures.
